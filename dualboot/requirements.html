		<h1>Below are the essential programs we need</h1>
		
		<ul>
			<li>dmg</li>
			<li>iBoot32Patcher</li>
			<li>ida_patcher</li>
			<li>img3maker</li>
			<li>imagine</li>
			<li>reimagine</li>
			<li>Hex Editor of your choice (hex fiend)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			You can find these in the CLI folder of this my repo "Dual-Boot-Stuff."<br>
			<br>
			The other programs are not needed but aid in research and adding a few more elements to the dualboot, or anything that resides in a similar process.
