		NOR method is where we use NOR and LLB to bootstrap iBEC and load the filesystem, which we've patched to utilize the upgrade command.<br>	
		We can also use this method because we can use LLB to find and decrypt a file with the tag of "ibec," which would be the one that we've patched,<br>
		to load iBEC. NOR is where our files are stored when we restore, and used to boot the device. So, this means we have to restore using this method.<br>
		There really isn't a benefit versus using multi_kloader to bootstrap iBSS + iBEC. If you do not want to go through restoring, then this method is not for you,<br>
		at least from the beginning. If you have already, and successfully dualbooted, then this is another method that you can learn and get some experience in patching various iBoot's.

	<p class="cli">./reimagine Firmware/all_flash/all_flash."device".production/LLB."device".RELEASE.img3 LLB.raw -iv -k -r</p>

	<p class="cli">./iBoot32Patcher LLB.raw LLB.prepatched -r</p>

	<p>
		Open LLB.prepatched in IDA, select ARM as the processor, and do everything else that we do we each iBoot.<br>	
		LLB and iBSS share the same rebase. Analyze the code and rebase the program to 0x84000000.<br>
	</p>

	<p>Scroll down from the top of the file (code) until you find this. Should be around 0x800-0xA00</p>

		We need to change "MOVW R0, #0x6F74" to "MOVW R0, #0x6563" This is because LLB looks<br>
		for a file in NOR with the tag of ibot. In normal routines, LLB decrypts and loads iBoot.<br>
		We need LLB to load iBEC. In order to do this, we need to change the value in LLB to load<br>
		iBEC instead. This is accessible by changing the value of "ot" to "ec", since we don't need<br>
		to change "ib." Also, as you can see, tags are also in Little-Endian. Make sure the first<br>
		value is "ec" and not "ib." Change "46 F6 74 70" to "46 F2 63 50."

	<p>Like the other iBoot's, produce a dif file, and then apply the dif with ida_patcher.</p>

	<p class="cli">./ida_patcher -i LLB.prepatched -p LLB.dif</p>

	<p>
		Save the patched LLB, with the patched iBEC (or make another if already removed) place it in Firmware/all_flash/all_flash."device".production/<br>
		Rename your patched iBEC with a custom name. As in Nyan's guide, we can just rename it as iBoot2.img3. Open manifest with nano or some text viewer.<br>
		Add the name of the patched iBEC, in this case we name it to iBoot2.img3. Save, then repack everything into a .ipsw archive, and then restore.
