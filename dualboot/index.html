<title>iOS Dualbooting</title>

<div align="center">

<p>
Dualbooting is a process in which we take advantage of iBEC/iBoot's ota upgrade routines. This is because when you're upgrading your device via ota (over-the-air), iBEC\iBoot uses<br>
specific files and mount points which we can tinker with. And, instead of upgrading the main os, we're telling iBEC/iBoot that we want the "upgraded" os at a specific partition, <br>
thus creating our "secondary" os.

<p>
Also note that this is not intended to copy off Nyan's guide. I'd prefer everyone to look over Nyan's guide before looking at mine. I've only made this to dumb <br>
it down for people like me who had some very hard and confusing times that lasted for hours or even days. So, this guide is for people who absolutely have no clue what they are <br>
doing and would rather have a dummy like myself write a guide explaining the mistakes which you could make like I did.
