<h2>fixing futurerestore</h2>
<p>
  There are missing headers we need to add in order to compile successfully.
  The files are both located at external/idevicerestore/src/<br />
  The first one we need to add is <code>&lt;linux/limits.h&gt;</code>, this
  needs to be placed in ipsw.c.<br />
  The second, make sure this is at the top of the file. In file socket.c,
  insert <code>#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200112L</code>
</p>

<h2>adding libipatcher</h2>
<p>
  In order to compile libipatcher, we need to compile xpwn. I have maintained
  a fork of my own that<br />
  I've tested and compiled for each OS.<br />
  Clone the xpwn fork: git clone https://github.com/merculous/xpwn<br />
  Inside xpwn folder, create a build folder: mkdir build<br />
  Before we start building, we need to add PIE stuff or else nothing will
  compile.<br />
  Add "set_property(TARGET common PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)" in
  common/CMakeLists.txt<br />
  And "set_property(TARGET xpwn PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)" in
  ipsw-patch/CMakeLists.txt<br />
  Xpwn requires OpenSSL 1.0.2, lets download it: curl -O
  https://www.openssl.org/source/old/1.0.2/openssl-1.0.2u.tar.gz<br />
  Cd into openssl folder: ./config; sudo make; sudo make install;<br />
  Now, we need to tell cmake to use openssl 1.0.2: cmake
  -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/ssl -DOPENSSL_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/ssl/lib
  ..<br />
  Time, to compile (You will get ld errors, don't worry, as long as you see
  "[100%] Built target xpwn" you're good): make libXPwn.a<br />
  Copy libcommon.a and libxpwn.a to /usr/local/lib:<br />
  sudo find -name libcommon.a -exec cp -rv {} /usr/local/lib/ \; sudo find
  -name libxpwn.a -exec cp -rv {} /usr/local/lib/ \;<br />
  Now, last important step, we need to add headers to the right place so
  libipatcher, later on, will find the headers.<br />
  cd ..; sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/xpwn; sudo unzip -d
  /usr/local/include/xpwn xpwn-modified-headers.zip
</p>

<h2>fixing liboffsetfinder64</h2>
<p>
  Later on, you will get errors regarding kernel patching. We can just skip
  over these.<br />
  Inside liboffsetfinder64 open Makefile.am, you will see entries of files:<br />
  machopatcherfinder64.cpp and kernelpatcherfinder64.cpp, remove those.<br />
  If you did this correctly, the files are still there, but they never get
  used.<br />
  Everything should compile, and you should now have a futurerestore with
  iBoot patching support!
