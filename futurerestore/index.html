<title>Cross-Compiling futurerestore with libipatcher support</title>

<p>

    This guide will be the subject of compiling futurerestore for MacOS, Linux, and Windows.<br>
    You may not have to use the exact same "patches" from what I've used, but in a general sense,<br>
    this guide will enable you to restore via futurerestore with libipatcher (an iBoot patching library),<br>
    in which will allow the usage of downgrading devices with OTA blobs by using checkm8. This means<br>
    you don't have to be jailbroken. Because of checkm8, we can just boot patched iBoot from DFU.
