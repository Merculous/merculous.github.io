<h1>JailbreakMe 1.0</h1>
<h2>Jailbreak for iOS 1.0-1.1.1</h2>
<p>This is a WebKit jailbreak for iOS 1.0-1.1.1. Rewritten and of course re-published by me. This is the original code
and has some minor changes to make this run again. This code is also on GitHub.<link href="https://github.com/OpenJailbreak
  evasi0n6/"> </p>
<p>I will be adding in the code after everything is stable!</p>
