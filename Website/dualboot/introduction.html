<h2>Optional: </h2>

  You don't really need xpwntool. I mostly use it just to remove img3 tags from already patched files to review patches. So, I personally prefer reimagine because I use it more.
  Also, reimagine comes with "ibootsup" which is basically like an older version of iBoot32Patcher except that it has pre-defined boot-args. You can still make changes to them.

  You also don't have to compile the programs above as I already have them compiled. Link to my repo which has them:
