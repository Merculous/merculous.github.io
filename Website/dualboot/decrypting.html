    So, of course, to even begin our patching, we need to remove the image3 tags and decrypt the files. You can either use xpwntool or reimagine, it really doesn't matter.
    If your following this guide by how I do it, I'd use reimagine for almost all of the decrypting.

    Extract the files: Applelogo, Devicetree, iBEC, iBSS, Kernelcache, Ramdisk.

    Also, if you're doing your very first manual dualboot, keep the ramdisk. If you've managed to create a working dualboot, there's no need for ramdisk.
