  <h1>Brief Summary</h1>
<p> align="left" I'm currently a 16 year old who doesn't really have any interests like most normal people have around my age (statistically speaking). I love messing with dual-boots,
   even though it takes a bunch of my time, and I'm still working on making more patches and whatever nonsense I can come up with.</p>
